*Version: 1.0.0*
*Last Updated: 18 May 2026*

This document serves as the master record of the Golden Goal platform's architecture, economy, and feature set.

## 1. Core Mechanics & Economy

### 1.1 Golden Token (GG)
The central currency of the platform.
- **Acquisition:** Users start with a base balance (or test balance for now). They earn tokens by winning bets, completing social tasks, and referring friends.
- **Usage:** Betting on matches, playing the Lucky Spin, staking for tier benefits.

### 1.2 Betting System
- **Markets:** Users can place predictions on Match Outcomes (Home Win, Away Win, Draw), BTTS (Both Teams to Score), Under/Over 2.5 Goals, and Correct Score.
- **Constraints:** Predictions cannot be changed within 5 minutes of the match start time. Modifying a prediction costs 10 tokens. Deleting a prediction costs 20 tokens.

## 2. Staking Tiers & Benefits

Users can lock their tokens to unlock VIP benefits.
- **Tier 1 (Soft Stake):** 750 Token Spin Cost, 1 Bonus Daily Bet
- **Tier 2 (7 Days):** 500 Token Spin Cost, 3 Bonus Daily Bets
- **Tier 3 (15 Days):** 250 Token Spin Cost, 5 Bonus Daily Bets
- **Tier 4 (30 Days):** 250 Token Spin Cost (after 1st free spin), 1 Free Spin Daily, 10 Bonus Daily Bets

*Note: Non-stakers (Tier 0) pay 1000 tokens per spin and must hold a minimum balance of 10,000 Golden Tokens to prevent whale-abuse.*

## 3. Social Growth & Gamification
